# Create and manage a VM

Atlas chooses a host and stores the VM request. Metal applies that request on the host. Start with [how one VM request works](../start/how-a-vm-request-works.md) to learn which component owns each state.

## Create a VM

Atlas [chooses a host](placement.md), saves a draft reservation, and asks Metal to create the VM. Metal accepts the request before the guest is ready. Follow the linked request guide for the full create flow and lost-response behavior.

## Change a VM

Atlas sends power, restart, resource, network, key, and metadata changes to the assigned host. Metal reports the applied generation separately from request acceptance.

See [guest metadata](vm-records.md#guest-metadata) for the limits on custom metadata and other MMDS values.

A resize uses the current host if it has enough capacity. Otherwise, Atlas can reserve another host and use [migration](migration.md).

Read [Metal's requested and applied generations](reconciliation.md) for current progress. The Atlas VM list uses [cached host reports](../region/host-sync.md).

## Read VM metrics

Metal samples each VM every 10 seconds. It records CPU time, memory use, disk size and use, disk read and write rates, configured disk limits, and received and sent network traffic.

Sent traffic includes ICMP, UDP, TCP SYN, and TCP RST packet counters. Disk use is from the last reconcile pass, so it can be older than the sample time. A stopped VM has no current CPU, memory, or disk I/O use.

Disk rates come from the VM systemd cgroup's `io.stat` counters for the root disk device. Metal stores whole read and write bytes per second and milli-IOPS, where 1,000 milli-IOPS is one operation per second.

The first sample after Metal starts, and the first sample after a counter reset, stores zero rates. Configured throughput and IOPS limits are zero when unlimited.

The VM unit template enables `IOAccounting=yes`. Before the template takes effect on an existing running VM, enable accounting on that unit with `systemctl set-property --runtime metal-vm@<vm-id>.service IOAccounting=yes`. If `io.stat` is absent, Metal logs a VM sampling error.

Metal keeps seven days of samples in daily files under `machines/<vm-id>/metrics/` on the VM's current host. An hourly cleanup removes complete expired files, so disk cleanup can lag by less than one day. Deleting or migrating a VM removes its local history. The metrics worker does not collect host usage.

Each JSONL line and metrics API sample stores its `timestamp` as UTC Unix seconds.

Read samples with `GET /api/atlas/virtual-machines/<vm-id>/metrics`. The caller must own the VM. Optional `start` and `end` timestamps select a range within the last seven days. The default range is 24 hours. Atlas reads the host only when this endpoint is called.

Ranges longer than one day return the latest sample in each five-minute bucket, with disk I/O rates averaged across the bucket. `sample_interval_seconds` is 300 for these ranges and 0 for raw samples. Network and CPU values are cumulative counters; divide the difference between adjacent samples by their elapsed seconds to calculate an average rate.

Network counters count unicast IPv4 and IPv6 packets at the VM TAP. The protocol counters read direct transport headers; IPv6 extension headers and later IPv4 fragments still increase the total packet count but not the protocol count. A Metal restart or TAP reattachment resets network counters, so discard a negative counter difference when calculating rates.

## Terminate a VM

1. Atlas requests destruction and marks its record as terminating.
2. Metal removes runtime, network, and disk resources through saved cleanup checkpoints.
3. Atlas removes its record after Metal confirms absence.

Public-address allocation has a separate retry path.

## Failure and recovery

Keep uncertain drafts and terminating records when Metal does not answer. [Find a problem](../operate/find-a-problem.md) starts with the assigned host, Metal progress, and Atlas jobs. For guest access, use the [console](console.md).

::: details Source code and tests

- [Atlas VM service](../../atlas/vm/core/vm_service.py) owns draft creation and host calls.
- [Placement context](../../atlas/vm/core/placement/context.py) reserves host capacity.
- [Atlas reconciliation](../../atlas/vm/core/reconciliation.py) settles uncertain drafts and terminations.
- [Metal manager](../../metal/internal/vm/manager.go) stores the create request and checks retries.
- [Metal reconciliation](../../metal/internal/vm/reconcile.go) applies and removes host resources.
- [Atlas VM tests](../../atlas/vm/core/test_vm_service.py) and [Metal manager tests](../../metal/internal/vm/manager_test.go) check the two commit points.
